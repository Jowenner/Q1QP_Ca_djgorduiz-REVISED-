                <h2>Background of the study</h2>
                <p>
                    In today's fast-paced world, technology has greatly advanced, providing us with numerous amazing inventions 
                    and a globally connected network called the Internet. This digital era has transformed our lives, jobs, and 
                    communication, allowing us to connect with people from all over the globe. Unfortunately, these same tools 
                    that have brought us closer together are now being misused, and we are experiencing the negative effects. 
                    Social media has greatly influenced the digital world, enabling people to share their thoughts and experiences 
                    worldwide. This has revolutionized how we communicate, share information, and do business. However, the constant 
                    presence of social media has negatively impacted users' mental health. Social media, which was originally intended
                     to create connections and facilitate communication, has become a mixed blessing. It can be addictive, with its
                      never-ending stream of information, making it difficult for users to break free. People often find themselves 
                      caught in a cycle of comparing themselves to others, consuming carefully curated content, and dealing with 
                      constant notifications, which can negatively impact their mental health. This creates a difficulty in user's balancing
                      between their digital and physical worlds, causing them to overlook the importance of in-person interactions 
                      for their emotional health.

                    And so, in this project, we aim to find the Time Spent on the Internet by the average Grade 9 students, 
                    and how, these numbers can be related to our performance in our academic journey.
                    We implement this by the use of sampling a number of the Grade 9 population (50 students)
                    and conducting a survey. And then, we simply compiled the results, calculated them accordingly, 
                    and displayed them to the statistics community.
