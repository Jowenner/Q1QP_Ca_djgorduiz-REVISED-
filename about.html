                <p> In the making of this project, facing initial challenges and receiving no responses to our survey as the deadline approached was undeniably disheartening. However, rather than succumbing to the setback, we rallied our determination and revised our approach. We diversified our outreach, refining our survey and re-strategizing its dissemination. It involved reaching out through various platforms, utilizing social media, directly engaging with potential respondents, and even reaching out to our network for support.

                    The persistence and resilience of the team became evident as we navigated through many other adversities. We reinforced our teamwork, communicating regularly, sharing ideas, and encouraging one another. This collective effort not only bolstered our morale but also broadened our perspective, allowing us to generate alternative solutions and reconsider our methodology.
                    
                    Moreover, these challenges turned out to be learning opportunities. They instilled in us the importance of adaptability and resilience in the face of unexpected hurdles. They taught us to embrace setbacks as a chance for growth and development. The process of persevering through the initial difficulties has not just refined our project but has also strengthened our unity and resolve as a team.
                    
                    As we moved forward, we celebrated as we, overcame this challenge that pushed us physically, mentally, and emotionally.

                    To introduce, this is the team who created this project. At the front, that would be me, David Jowenn R. Gorduiz from Grade 9 - Calcium. You know, I am a person who does goofy things sometimes, even borderline weird, so never judge me when approaching me in real life. Next, at the right, that would be John Edward, or John Edward De Leon from Grade 9 - Calcium. This person is a Taylor Swift fan or Swiftie for short. I am rather jealous of him because of how carefree he is - good for him. Lastly, at the left, that would be Floyd or Cebastian Floyd Banguis from Grade - 9 Calcium. He is one of the funny people in class so he is cool as well as surprisingly helpful. I learned that I shouldn’t be biased due to one’s appearance.
