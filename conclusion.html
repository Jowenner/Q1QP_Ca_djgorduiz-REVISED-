                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, the data shows a significant correlation between the amount of time teenagers 
                    spend on the internet and their academic performance, with variations between genders. 
                    Girls who dedicate more time to the internet tend to maintain good grades, while boys 
                    who spend more time online often struggle academically due to activities like online gaming. This is strengthened by the different graphs from the male and female groups, where, you can see t
                    he differences and the similarities. And so,  The internet offers a vast platform for learning, 
                    social interaction, and self-expression, expanding the horizons of grade 9 students. It is a 
                    valuable tool for simplifying knowledge and enhancing the learning process. To harness these 
                    benefits while safeguarding students' well-being, educators and parents must collaborate to s
                    trike a balance, fostering responsible digital citizenship and mitigating the potential 
                    risks of excessive online usage. 
                    </p>
                <p>
                    There's nothing wrong with using the internet for a long time as long 
                    as it doesn't affect your life, grades, and relationship with your 
                    family and friends. Time management matters.
